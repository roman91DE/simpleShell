# simpleShell

Lets build simpleShell, a simple shell that can execute commands and display output.
We will use only Standard Library python Code to write the Shell.

## Features

- Call external commands and display the output.
- Basic File globbing using \*
- inbuilt commands: cd, exit, help
- history of commands using up and down arrow keys

## Implementation

This shell should be usable for basic operations,
but it is not intended to be a full-featured shell.
It is a simple implementation to demonstrate how to execute commands and display the output in Go.
